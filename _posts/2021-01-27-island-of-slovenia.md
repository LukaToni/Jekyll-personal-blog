Slovenia is the most underrated country to travel in all of Europe. There are so many things to do in Slovenia: whitewater rafting, hiking, kayaking, exploring fun cities, delicious food and conversing with the lovely locals. Can you tell we fell in love with sLOVEnia?

Bordered by heavily touristed countries like Italy, Croatia, Hungary and Austria, Slovenia often gets overlooked. We were surprised to discover that it is just as beautiful as its neighbors (if not more so!), and we were pleased to find that unlike its neighbors it is not yet saturated with selfie sticks and tour groups.

The Slovenian seaside has gorgeous rocky beaches like Croatia, it has mountains and world class whitewater rafting like in Northern Italy. The country has marvelous lakes to explore in the summer and epic skiing in the winter like Austria. And it has cute little villages to discover like Hungary.

If Slovenia isnâ€™t on your radar, it definitely should be!
